1. Why do we listen for data and end events when handling POST?
-> Because data comes with small parts(chunks).'
We use "data" to collect each part and "end" to know when it's all recieved.

2. What would happen if we didnâ€™t buffer the body correctly?
-> We would get an broken or incompleted data and our form won't work.

3. What is the format of form submissions when using the default browser form POST?
-> The default is: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

4. Why do we use fs.appendFile instead of fs.writeFile?
->
_ fs.appendFile: add new data without delete the old data.
_ fs.writeFile: replace everything in the file.

5. How could this be improved or made more secure?
->
_ Error handling
_ Stored data securely
_ Use framework
_ Input Validation
